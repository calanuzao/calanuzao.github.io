            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I’m an Acoustical Engineer who began in finance and marketing—not out of trend or fashion, but out of a genuine interest in how people make decisions, express needs, and find value. I’ve always believed that understanding people is the foundation of building anything meaningful. Often, what’s asked for is not what’s truly needed. That subtle gap has always fascinated me.</p>

            <p>Then I lost part of my hearing. The listening part of my identity—the part that made me curious, attentive, and grounded—suddenly became difficult.</p>

            <p>That changed everything. I stopped thinking about sound as a product and started seeing it as a need. I realized real innovation doesn’t begin with an idea. It begins with a real problem.</p>

            <p>So I made a choice. I left the boardroom and stepped into the lab—not to abandon business, but to bring humanity into engineering.</p>

            <p>Today, I combine maths, physics, and code to design audio systems and assistive technologies that go beyond specs. I work at the molecular level of sound, shaping it with precision and purpose. Because the future of audio isn’t just about how it sounds—it’s about how it feels.</p>

            <p>I build what I wish I had. And I build it for everyone.</p>
